This package provides a quick interface for adding select boxes from which multiple elements may be selected.
The interface is similar to the Laravel Collective [HTML](https://github.com/LaravelCollective/html/) package,
and aims to be compatible with it. However, you can use this library without Laravel Collective's HTML.

This package adheres to [PSR 1, 2 and 4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/).

## Requirements

- [PHP > 5.6](http://php.net)
- [Laravel 5.4|5.5](https://github.com/laravel/framework)
- [jQuery > 2.0?](http://jquery.com)

## Install

Via Composer (when on Packagist)

``` bash
$ composer require andrechalom/laravel-multiselect
```

### Service Provider & Facade

Register provider and facade on your config/app.php file. This is necessary for Laravel 5.4, but optional for >= 5.5.

```php
'providers' => [
    ...,
    AndreChalom\LaravelMultiselect\MultiselectServiceProvider::class,
]

 'aliases' => [ 
    ...,
    'Multiselect' => AndreChalom\LaravelMultiselect\MultiselectFacade::class,
 ]
```

### Javascript Configuration

The jQuery code required by this package is in the file multiselect.js. If you use Laravel Mix, you can include it
in your mix.js. Otherwise, copy it to your public folder and source it directly in the app layout. 
Remember to do it after you include jquery.

Example:

```js
mix.js([
    'resources/assets/js/app.js',
    'vendor/andrechalom/laravel-multiselect/resources/assets/js/multiselect.js',
    ], 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/assets/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');
```

## Usage

- (1) The default behavior creates a select element with an area where the selected options are placed. 
Use any key => value array to populate the select.

``` php
$list = [
    'r' => 'red',
    'g' => 'green',
    'b' => 'blue',
];

{!! Multiselect::select('colors', $list) !!}
```

To provide initial selected options, pass a list of keys as the third argument. All keys in this argument are supposed
to be in the options list:

``` php
{!! Multiselect::select('colors', $list, ['r', 'b']) !!}
```

This can be populated from Eloquent models:

``` php
{!! Multiselect::select('colors', Colors::all()->pluck('name', 'id'), $person->favoriteColors()->pluck('id')) !!}
```

TODO: explain how to generate the span separately; setting attributes for select, options, span.

If you decide to change the select element class, append "multiselect" to the class definition, or the Javascript code
won't work. Example: `['class' => 'form-control multiselect'].

- (2) In the Controller, the selected options will be in a array. 
```php
public function update(Request $request, $id) {
    ...
    $person->favoriteColors()->sync($request->colors);
}
```

- (3) style: the span elements generated with Multiselect are of the "multiselector" css class. You can style them as you like, for instance

```css
.multiselector { display: inline-block; border: 1px dashed; padding: 2px; margin: 5px; cursor: pointer; }
.multiselector:after { font-family: "Glyphicons Halflings"; content: "\e014"; padding-left: 3px; }
```
